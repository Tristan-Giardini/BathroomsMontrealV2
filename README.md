# BathroomsMontreal

<p>
Bathrooms Montreal is a collaboration between Oliver Mercer-Smail and Tristan Giardini. This project is the first 'post bootcamp' project for them. The idea is a simple one: when you need to use a washroom, you should be able to.</p>

<p>Bathrooms montreal is a user based platform where you can geolocate yourself and find a nearby bathroom to use. Users can also input a public bathroom to the map, or contact us about any concerns.</p>

<p>Accessibility is important to us, and we want to use tech to make the world more accessible.</p>
<p>This project uses Mapbox API, ReactJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, and emailJS.</p>
